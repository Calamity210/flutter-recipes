# Packages

Here are some packages I have published:

## boxy

This library provides several widgets and utilities that enable you to create advanced layouts without in-depth
knowledge of the framework and minimal boilerplate.

## async_builder

This package provides `AsyncBuilder`, a widget similar to `StreamBuilder` / `FutureBuilder` which is designed to reduce
boilerplate and improve error handling.

It also provides `InitBuilder`, which makes it easier to start async tasks safely.

## spa

This is a Dart implementation of the Solar Position Algorithm (SPA) by Ibrahim Reda and Afshin Andreas which is used by
the U.S. government for radiology and energy purposes. See the paper here:
[https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/34302.pdf](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/34302.pdf)

Given an observers coordinates and DateTime it can calculate the position of the sun and other information such as when
the sun rises and sets.
